# My North Coast 500 Website

![Mockup](docs/readme_images/nc500-site-mockup.jpg)

**Author Neil Allen**

## The North Coast 500

This is my website documenting our family trip around the NC500 in 2018. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for those new to the NC500 and those wishing to learn more.

It is designed to appeal to those who have never heard of the North Coast 500 and wish to find out more. It is also designed to appeal to those who are already aware of the route and are interested in reading about a fellow traveller's journey or are looking for inspiration.

The site will also appeal to those looking for imagery of the area and/or links to related content and services.

## Project Inception and Planning

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### First Time Visitor Goals

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand what and where the North Coast 500 is.
        2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily navigate throughout the site to find content.
        3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to read about an actual trip around the NC500 and look at interesting images.

    -   #### Returning Visitor Goals

        1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find more information that may help me plan a trip.
        2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact and ask for help and advice with any questions I may have.
        3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find links to other resources that will help me plan.

    -   #### Frequent User Goals
        1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added photographs.
        2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there is any new information.
        3. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new links.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   To fit in with the main colours of the Scottish Flag (Saltire), i've chosen blue as the colour scheme for the site with a contrast between a dark blue for menu items and footer, and a sandy colour to represent the stunning beaches as background. I've added a contrasting bronze as this looks good. I have added a green highlight to the current page icon.

        -   On some pages i've also added a light blue to soften the screen and ensure WCAG contrast compliance. Hyperlinks have been coloured to provide a contrast compatible with WCAG guidelines.
        
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Baskerville Libre font is the main font used for headings and Open Sans is used for other text consistently throughout the whole website. Sans Serif is the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Baskeville is a clean font and looks crisp on blue or a white background. It is both elegant and professional.

    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The NC500 is especially famous for its views and scenery so this requires a large, background hero image designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It is essential that the site has a gallery area to fully communicate the variety of the NC500's scenic experiences.

        -   The site is image rich as that is a key feature of the NC500. Most images are my own, with some copyright free images and attribution where required.


    -   #### Design Considerations
        -   The header of each page carries a different Hero or banner image but other items remain consistent. The Footer is minimalist as its not necessary to give out extensive contact information. There's an email option, a link to the main contact page and form and 5 social media links.

        -   Larger screen sizes have the waving saltire gif but this is hidden on smaller screens as it occupies too much space whilst adding little value. 

        -   The site is responsive with some items hidden or resized for smaller screens.

        -   Menu navigation remains in the centre of the screen on all viewing sizes and is at optimum eye height.

        -   There is a customised error-404 page 'just in case'.

-   ### **Structure**

    The structure of the site is informed by the the target audience's expectations and the principles of IXD (interaction design) to make sure I was making everything as intuitive as I could.


    The site has a simple structure made up of 4 pages:
    * Homepage - a short introduction to what the North Coast 500 is.
    * Our Trip - Specific information and images about our journey around the NC500 in
     August 2018.
    * Gallery - A range of images to show the variety and beauty of the NC500 route
    * Comments - A form to allow the user to send comments or requests for further information.

    * There are also 2 additional sub pages
        -   A Confirmation thank you page for when a user has submitted a form
        -   A 404 page for when a user lands on a non-existent page

    The site has a navbar which remains central to the screen on desktop, tablet and mobile, this allows a user to access any page they need at any time and is suitable for a first time or returning visitor. There is also a footer on every page with links to social media sites, the Comments page and a direct email link.

## Features

-   Responsive on all device sizes down to 280px - the industry standard minimum screen width.

-   Interactive elements

-   Active menu page is highlighted in Green on menu options and menu items enlarge on Hover.

* Gallery
    * A selection of images which spread across the screen in a resposnsive style.
    * Clicking on a thumbnail image opens a larger version in full screen with navigation backwards and forwards and an autoplay function. 
    * The code requires Java script and is not my own. It was obtained from https://nanogallery.brisbois.fr/. 
    * I added the functionality of a label to the Thumbnail and enlarged image.
    * I created thumbnail images for all main images.
    * I changed the colour scheme of the icons to match the rest of the site. 
    * I created a small additional CSS file to manipulate IMG properties for this page alone.

### Contact Page
* Contact form
    * A contact form will be implemented to allow users to contact me. The form will consist of the following fields and attributes: 
        * First Name (required, type=text)
        * Last Name (required, type=text)
        * Email (required, type=email)
        * Message (required, type=textarea), maximum 280 characters
    * Muted Text will be used as hints or for assurance on certain fields. This will be adjusted, if necessary, for WCAG compliance.
    * This will allow a user to contact me if they have any queries about the NC500, our trip in particular or information to assist in planning their own adventure.
    * To avoid large empty spaces and as i didn't wish to expand the form to the entire screen on laptop screens and above, I have inserted the NC500 logo either side. This is hidden on smaller screen sizes.

### Responsiveness

All pages were tested to ensure responsiveness on screen sizes from 280px and upwards as defined in [WCAG 2.1 Reflow criteria for responsive design](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/reflow.html) on the following browsers:
- Chrome    (123.0.6312.106)
- Edge      (123.0.2420.81)
- Firefox   (124.0.2)
- Safari    (17.4)
- Opera     (109.0.5097.24).

Steps to test:

1. Open browser and navigate to
[The North Coast 500](https://neil7057.github.io/mp1-nc500/)
2. Open the developer tools (right click and inspect)
3. Set to responsive and decrease widthin stages to 280px
4. Set the zoom to 50%
5. Click and drag the responsive window to maximum width, noting transitions at breakpoints
6. Rotate and test for portrait to landscape transition

Results:

Website is responsive on all screen sizes and no images are pixelated or stretched.
No horizontal scroll is present.
No elements overlap.
Text resizes as expected at breakpoints.
Some content is hidden where it would clutter smaller screens.

Website was also opened on the following devices and no responsive issues were seen:

- iPhone X, 12, 14
- Apple iPad 12.9
- Fujitsu 15.4in laptop
- Hp 22in desktop

### Accessibility

[Wave Accessibility](https://wave.webaim.org/) tool was used throughout development
and for final testing of the deployed website to check for any aid accessibility testing.

Testing was focused to ensure the following criteria were met:

- All forms have associated labels or aria-labels so that this is read out on a screen reader to users who tab to form inputs.

- Color contrasts meet a minimum ratio as specified in
  [WCAG 2.1 Contrast Guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum.html).    

- Heading levels are not missed or skipped to ensure the importance of content is relayed correctly to the end user.

- All content is contained within landmarks to ensure ease of use for assistive technology, allowing the user to navigate by page regions.

- All non-textual content has alternative text or titles so descriptions are read out to screen readers.

- HTML page lang attribute has been set.

- Aria properties have been implemented correctly.

- WCAG 2.1 Coding best practices being followed.

- Hyperlink text colour has been adjusted to adhere to contrast guidelines.

Results:

<details><summary>Home Page</summary>
<img src="docs/testing/wave-index.jpg">
</details>
<br>
The ourtrip page reports 2 alerts for video content.
However there is no audio on the video, so no transcript required. The videos have aria-labels that are detected by screen reading software (NVDA).

</details>
<br>
The Gallery Page uses third party code for an image caroussel and slideshow.
It duplicates file names as part of its function so flags duplicate file name errors at WCAG. 
Alt texts have been added to all images which arent detected by the WAVE scanner labels
but are detected by Screen Reader software (NVDA).

### Functional Testing

**Navigation Links**

Testing was performed to ensure all navigation links on the respective pages, navigated to the correct pages as per design.
This was done by clicking on the navigation links on each page on a desktop, laptop, tablet and mobile device.

Links on all pages navigated to the correct pages as expeccted.

**Form Testing**

The form on the contact page was tested to ensure it functioned as expected when correct and incorreet data was input.

Specifically:

-   Missing one or more input field:
    An error was highlighted to the user and the form could not be submitted.

-   Incorrect email format:
    An error was highlighted to the user and the form could not be submitted.
    
-   Form completed correctly with valid information in all fields:
    The form is able to be submitted.

-   Form textarea will only accept 280 characters

-   Succesfully submission of the contacts/feedback form: A confirmation message is displayed  

**Links Testing**

Testing was performed to:

-   Open each hyperlink on each page and check that it is a valid URL and opens in a new page.

-   Check on desktop, tablet and mobile.


**Footer Social Media Icons / Links**

Testing was performed on the Font Awesome Social Media icons in the footer to ensure that each one opened in a new tab and that each one
had a 'grow' hover affect of the orange branding color.

Each item opened a new tab when clicked as expected and correct hover effect was present.

**Footer Contact Information**

Steps to test Email Link:

Navigate to  [My North Coast 500 - Home Page](https://neil7057.github.io/mp1-nc500/).
 
Click the email address in the footer (webdev1961@gmail.com).

A windows popup is displayed asking what application you would like to send a mail from
or your default email application is opened.

There is also a link directly to the comments/feedback page.
When clicked, this navigates to the correct page.
On the comments page itself, this link goes to the top of the form.

The email and 'go to' links react when hovered over.

### Further Testing

-   Testing was carried out as each function was developed. The menu structure, navigation and footer were tested until error free on Index.html before propogating to other pages.

-   As each page was completed, existing succesful tests were rerun to ensure that proven functionality hadn't been affected. 

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7/8/X and iPad.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### 404 Error Testing

- A bespoke 404 error page has been created to provide a better user experience
- This was tested by:
    - navigating to the comments page and changing the address to comment.html in the browser.
    - The dedicated 404-error was displayed and it was possible to navigate home via the home button.

### Known Bugs

- There are no known errors.   

## Deployment

### Version Control

The site was created using the Visual Studio code editor and pushed to github to the remote repository:
‘mp1-nc500’.

The following git commands were used throughout development to push code to the remote repo:

```git add <file>``` 
    - This command was used to add the file(s) to the staging area before they are committed.

```git commit -m “commit message”```
    - This command was used to commit changes to the local repository queue ready for the final step.

**Following feedback from my mentor, I changed the format of my Git Commit messages to be more industry standard and imperative. This change took effect from commit 31.**

```git push``` 
    - This command was used to push all committed code to the remote repository on github.

### GitHub Pages

The project was deployed to GitHub Pages using the following steps...

### Deployment to Github Pages

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
- From the menu on left select 'Pages'
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Branch: main
- Click 'Save'
- A live link will be displayed in a green banner when published successfully. 

    [The live link can be found here](https://neil7057.github.io/mp1-nc500/)
