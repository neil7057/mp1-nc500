# My North Coast 500 Website

This is my website documenting our family trip around the NC500 in 2018. It is designed to be responsive and accessible on a range of devices, making it easy to navigate for those new to the NC500 and those wishing to learn more.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   To fit in with the main colours of the Scottish Flag (Saltire), i've chosen blue and white as the colour scheme for the site.
        
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Madimi One font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Madimi One is a clean font and looks crisp in blue on a white background. It is both elegant and professional.

    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The NC500 is especially famous for its view and scenery so this requires a large, background hero image designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It is essential that the site has a gallery area to fully communicate the variety od the NC500's scenic experiences.
